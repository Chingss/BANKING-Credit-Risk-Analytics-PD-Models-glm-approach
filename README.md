## OBJECTIVES:
The original task of estimating the risk of default has been augmented by credit scoring models to include other aspects of credit risk
management: at the pre-application stage (identification of potential applicants), at the application stage (identification of acceptable
applicants), and at the performance stage (identification of possible behavior of current customers).
Scoring models with different objectives have been developed. They can be generalized into four categories as listed below.

### 1.MARKETING ASPECT:
#### Purposes:
Identify credit-worthy customers most likely to respond to promotional activity in order to reduce the cost of customer acquisition and
minimize customer dissatisfaction.
Predict the likelihood of losing valuable customers and enable organizations to formulate effective customer retention strategy.

#### Examples:
Response scoring: The scoring models that estimate how likely a consumer would respond to a direct mailing of a new product.

Retention/attrition scoring: The scoring models that predict how likely a consumer would keep using the product or change to 
another lender after the introductory offer period is over.

### 2.APPLICATION ASPECT Purposes
Decide whether to extend credit, and how much credit to extend.
Forecast the future behavior of a new credit applicant by predicting loan- default chances or poor repayment behaviors at the time the credit is granted.
#### Examples:
Applicant scoring: The scoring models that estimate how likely a new applicant of credit will become default.

### 3.PERFORMANCE ASPECT Purpose:
Predict the future payment behavior of existing debtors in order to identify/isolate bad customers to direct more attention and assistance
to them, thereby reducing the likelihood that these debtors will later become a problem.
#### Examples:
Behavioral scoring. Scoring models that evaluate the risk levels of existing debtors.
### 4.BAD DEBT MANAGEMENT Purpose:
Select optimal collections policies in order to minimize the cost of administering collections or maximizing the amount recovered from a delinquentâ€™s account.
#### Examples:
Scoring models for collection decisions: Scoring models that determine when actions should be taken on the accounts of delinquents and 
which of several alternative collection techniques might be more appropriate and successful.
Thus, the overall objective of credit scoring is not only to determine whether the applicant is credit worthy, but also to attract 
quality credit applicants who can subsequently be retained and controlled while maintaining an overall profitable portfolio.
